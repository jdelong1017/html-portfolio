<h1>The Top 4 Best TV Shows According to Jason</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Heartstopper</h2>
<p>I love this show because it's the first show that I was able to see my young queer self in.</p>
<h2>Grey's Anatomy</h2>
<p>I have an emotional and spiritual connection to this show.  I can watch it over and over again and never get bored of it.</p>
<h2>How to Get Away with Murder</h2>
<p>This show brings out the best acting in Viola Davis.  She shows the rawness of Analise Keating in a way that's never been done by a woman of color on mainstream television.  It's ICONIC!</p>
<h2>Scandal</h2>
<p>Olivia Pope is BADASS!! Need I say more?</p>
